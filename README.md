# SCAI7-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning✨
This project focuses on practical applications of Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques in the MSIB program, AI Track, at Startup Campus. The tasks include:
### 👥`MachineLearning-Supervised-Classification`: 
Predicting customer churn status in banking by classifying customers based on their likelihood to leave the service.
### ⚛️`MachineLearning-Unsupervised-Clustering`: 
Determining the optimal number of clusters from random data points using clustering algorithms.
### 🏘️`DeepLearning-Supervised-Regression`: 
Predicting house prices using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model for regression tasks.
### 💳`DeepLearning-Supervised-Classification`: 
Classifying credit card fraud transactions using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for supervised classification.
